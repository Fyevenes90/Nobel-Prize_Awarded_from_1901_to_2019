## Nobel-Prize_Awarded_from_1901_to_2019
#### In this project I practice visualizations with the Nobel prize awarded data from 1901 to 2019, I will be using libraries like:
  - ploty.express
  - seaborn
  - Pandas
  - plotly.graph_objects

#### The idea of the project is to play around with the different visualization, I will do some checks in the data to make sure there's not null data and then we will conduct some visualizations:
  - In general categories in which Nobel prize have been received
  - Categories in which a man have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Countries in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
